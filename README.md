In 2008 and 2018, I did some reverse-engineering of the HHC intrinisic
(internal) ROM, and the SnapFORTH development ROMs. I started
reverse-engineering the SnapBASIC development ROM, but didn't accomplish
much there.

This repository holds the partially reverse-engineered code, which can
be cross-assmebled using
[Macro Assembler AS](http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/).

I do not claim Copyright on the original HHC binary ROM image,
but do claim Copryight on the unique aspects of the reverse-engineered
file, including but not limited to labels and comments.
